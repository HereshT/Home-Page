                        structure for a web page. Learn the basics of HTML Make a few pages as an exercise You can check Tutorial For HTML. ii. CSS: Second pillar of web development and used to style web pages so that they look good. Learn the basics
                        of CSS Style pages from the previous step Build a page with grid and flexbox You can check Tutorial For CSS. iii. JS Basics: Third pillar of web development and used to make your web pages interactive. Get familiar with the syntax
                        Learn basic operations on DOM Learn mechanisms typical for JS (Hoisting, Event Bubbling, Prototyping) Make some AJAX (XHR) calls Learn new features (ECMA Script 6+) Additionally, get familiar with the jQuery library</p>

                        HTTP(S) protocol, request methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS) Don't be afraid of using Google, Power Searching with Google Get familiar with the terminal, configure your shell (bash, zsh, fish) Read a few books about
                        algorithms and data structures Read a few books about design patterns. Git and Version Control Git is the tool used to save code and create different versions, allowing you to collaborate with other developers. The top place to
                        store code and collaborate on open source software is GitHub.</p>

                    <h3>About me: Why Now & Why coding!?</h3>
                    <h4>First, I apologize in advance for my English. To begin with, I have always been patient to discover new territories, face challenges and learn new subjects which considered to be difficult from scratch. I strongly believe and speaking
                        from my experiences; our capabilities are beyond imagination, but other elements are involved, so the key to success are not just those potentials and even genius. Hard work, consistency, determination, commitment and setting your
                        goals play an enormous role. (Do not compare yourself to anyone as our background, our past and stories are different. In my opinion it is better not to begin such a journey at all, but if you have decided to do so, do your best.
                        ( 0 or 100 and not less than 80% ) and no matter what the results and outcome are as far as you do your best. Back to the title and question, coding has been always unknown to me, I mean literally zero knowledge in this case. Do
                        you believe in that everything happens for a reason? Of course I had heard about coding many times but never caught my attention until few weeks ago a gentleman came to our ESOL class at the Cardonald College and introduced CYF.
                        I said to myself give it a shot and find out if it is your cup of tea or not. After spending two&three days on Grasshopper, I realized that I am not only enjoy it but also so passionate about it, not to mention that I am about
                        to learn and achieve a skill which can lead to a promising career. I am going to dead sit and enjoy learning to a very high standard even if it takes twice of the time in comparison to the others. I am keen on studying and learning,
                        playing chess, audio books, films, documentaries, nature, gym, coffee, cooking, music, archaeology, psychology, etc. as I believe life is too short and the real comfort and relaxation come from those kind of hobbies. Thank you
                        for taking your time and reading through my text.</h4>
